Abstract:

Object Detection is an elemental part of Computer vision with a wide range of real-world applications. It involves the detection of various objects in digital images or video. One such object detection algorithm is Yolo (You only look once) which has gained much popularity in the computer vision community due to its high performance and low inference time. In this project, we propose a proof of concept of how the Yolo algorithm can be leveraged to improve the maintenance of railway tracks operated by Via Rail Canada. Via rail operates approx 500 trains running on 12,500 km of track. These tracks pass through long stretches of sparsely populated lands which makes maintaining these tracks a tough job due to the sheer amount of resources required to identify the points of interest such as Vegetation, Missing or broken Tie, etc. This project uses the Yolo algorithm to identify these points of interest with the help of drone flights. This project also explores the performance of different versions of Yolo (Yolov4 & Yolov5) to achieve the highest accuracy possible.
